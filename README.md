# Wizarr Installation Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing Wizarr and building it locally on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the installation, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Linux or macOS:** This installation guide is primarily intended for Linux and macOS users. If you are using Windows, consider using a virtual machine or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

- **`curl` and `sh`:** You must have the `curl` and `sh` commands available in your terminal. These commands are typically pre-installed on most Unix-based systems.
- **`docker` and `docker compose`:** You should install Docker and Docker Compose on your system, however if you don't the install script should ask you to install these.

## Installation

To install Wizarr and build it locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run the following command to download the installation script and execute it:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL get.wizarr.dev -o get-wizarr.sh && sh get-wizarr.sh
   ```

   This command retrieves the installation script from the Wizarr website and runs it using the `sh` command.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions provided by the installation script. The script will guide you through the installation process and prompt you for any necessary information.

4. Once the installation is complete, Wizarr should be installed and ready to use on your system.
